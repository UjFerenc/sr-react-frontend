                <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
                <h1 class="text-center">Origin of everything</h1>
                <p>
                    At the begining only the Originators existed. They were an infinity powerful being, and there were an infity amount of them.
                    They were the perfect beings, but it came with a curse. Their perfection made their existents mondaine, borring. Unbearably borring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To cure themselfes of their boredom, the Originators created things to limit themselfs, and so logic was created, with time and space.
                    It made them less, and less powerful and with it less and less perfect. It was exiting for them, they just simply couldn't resist to create more imperfections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of them worked together to create the most imperfect thing they could make with the limitation of time, logic and space.
                    And with it life was created in the image of mocking perfection.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-center">The Shattering</h1>
                <p>
                    Over time the Originators started disagring over how the newly created Realm should be. One always tried to modify the realm, but two other stopped it.
                    This over time made the Realm Shatter. 
                </p>
                <p>This made the realm exist, multiple times simultaniusly, and in every piece an Originator ruling over it.</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">The Races</h1>
                <p>Four races were created to mock four aspecst of perfection</p>
                <h2>Humanity</h2>
                <p>
                    Humanity was created to mock the power of perfection. They have the potencial to achive anything, they can become perfect, 
                    but their lifespan prevents them from ever reaching it.
                </p>
                <h2>Beastmen</h2>
                <p>
                    They wer created to mock omni clayvorance. They have instincs that gives them a predictions in time of need, but never trully know what will happen.
                    Some beastmen are given incredable instincs, but their life usually ends by misunderstanding what their instincs tells them.
                </p>
                <h2>The Masquari</h2>
                <p>
                    Masquari were created to mock the originators when they were perfect. They were noting but copies of eachother.
                    A masquarus is born when a living creature dies. It replaces the original and try its best, to imitate them.
                    They don't have flesh, but pretend to need food, air, and to bleed out. When a masquarus dies this way, they will play dead until the end of times.
                    A masquarus is also incredibly powerful, but always pretends to be as weak as the one it replaces.
                </p>
                <h2>The Luci</h2>
                <p>
                    A lucus are made to mock the infinte numbers of the originators. They grow in sacred groows that they protect, 
                    But these grooves have limited recourses, so most lucus just either wonder the lands aimlessly, or wither away in the groove.
